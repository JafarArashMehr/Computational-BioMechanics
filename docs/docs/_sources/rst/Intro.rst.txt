**What is this document about?**
=========================================




This is a document including some cool computational projects on an open-source platform. 

:math:`\textbf {1.}` Briefly it starts with explaining the basic concepts of some hyperelastic material models and compares the analytical solutions with the numerical results based on finite element method (**FEM**).  

:math:`\textbf {2.}` In the second chapter, it goes over how to numercially solve a **Multi-Physics** problem using FEM. 

:math:`\textbf {3.}` In the third chapter, details of a **Differential Evolution** optimizaition algorithm will be described and later it will be explained how it could be used to implement Inverse FEM for tunining parameters in a numercial model to fit into the experimental data.
  
:math:`\textbf {4.}` The last chapter goes over the thoery and implementation of a supervised machine learning technique (**Linear Discriminant Analysis**) and going over an application in  disease diagnosis.  


.. note:: 

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basic concepts of continuum mechanics, as well as FEM and coding in Python.
