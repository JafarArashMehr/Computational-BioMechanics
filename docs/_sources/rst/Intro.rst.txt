**What is this document about?**
=========================================



:math:`\textbf {1.}` The first chapter talks about the basic concepts of some hyperelastic material models and compares the analytical solutions with the numerical results based on finite element method (**FEM**).  

:math:`\textbf {2.}` In the second chapter, it goes over how to numerically solve a **Multi-Physics** problem using FEM. 

:math:`\textbf {3.}` This chapter presents and solve an example to illustrate how a Multi-Physics model could be used for simulation of enhanced drug delivery 


:math:`\textbf {4.}` In this chapter, details of a **Differential Evolution** optimization algorithm will be described and later it will be explained how it could be used to perform Inverse FEM for tuning parameters in numerical model to fit into the experimental data.

:math:`\textbf {5.}` This chapter talks about some statistical concepts including **probability distribution** and **hypothesis testing**
  
:math:`\textbf {6.}` The main focus of this chapter is **linear regression** and how it could used for prediction of a variable

:math:`\textbf {7.}` This chapter goes through some concepts about :math:`Machine\: Learning` including **feature engineering**, **Bayes model**, **K-mean model**, **tree-based learning** and **random forest** 


:math:`\textbf {8.}` This chapter presents the theory and implementation of a supervised machine learning technique (**Linear Discriminant Analysis**) and goes over an example to delineate how it could be used in disease diagnosis.  




.. note:: 

   :math:`\bullet` For the first 4 chapters, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the basic concepts of continuum mechanics, as well as FEM and coding in Python. 

   :math:`\bullet` The contents and examples that will be presented in the chapters 5-7 are based on **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate** that I took and passed all the courses and received its certificate.
