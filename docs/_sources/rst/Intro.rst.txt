**What is this document about?**
=========================================



:math:`\textbf {1.}` The first chapter talks about the concepts of some hyperelastic material models and compares the analytical solutions with the numerical results based on finite element method (**FEM**).  

:math:`\textbf {2.}` In the second chapter, we explain how to solve a **Multi-Physics** problem numerically using FEM. 

:math:`\textbf {3.}` This chapter presents and solve an example to illustrate how a multi-Physics model could be used for simulation of enhanced drug delivery 

:math:`\textbf {4.}` In this chapter, details of a **Differential Evolution** optimization algorithm will be described 

:math:`\textbf {5.}` This chapter presents the theory and implementation of a supervised machine learning technique (**Linear Discriminant Analysis**) and goes over an example to demonstrate how it could be used in disease diagnosis.
